# BigGeo-data-scripts

Scripts used in the preprocessing phase of BigGeo's data are located in the BigGeo-data-scripts/Scripts/ directory.

Track to trip preprocessing algorithm slightly modified to fit our needs located in BigGeo-data-scripts/TrackToTrip-master-2/. Here perform "pip install ." to install all the dependencies. Rtree needs to be installed mannually on windows, example file for my machine, BigGeo-data-scripts/TrackToTrip-master-2/Rtree-0.8.3-cp37-cp37m-win32.whl ;
